                <h2>History</h2>
                <pr>  Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO.
                     It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones.
                      The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.
                       It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.
                       Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show.
                        The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it.
                         A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne.
                          The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border.</pr>

                  <pr><p>
                    The Iron Throne was the throne upon which the King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men sat.
                     Located in the Great Hall of the Red Keep in the city of King's Landing.
                     Besides the monarchs themselves, only their Hand could sit on the Iron Throne.
                     The Iron Throne was also a metonym, along with "the crown,"
                      referring to the monarchy that rules the Seven Kingdoms and the authority of the monarchy</p></pr>
